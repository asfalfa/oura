## About
Oura is a mock sports clothing website, created using a **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS).

## Usage
You can run the project from the main folder with **npm run dev**.

Admin users can upload products, and categories (shoes, shirts, etc...) are auto-generated when a product with a new category is uploaded.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Allow selection of how much stock a product has when uploaded, by size and color.
- [ ] Allow update of products once they are uploaded.
- [ ] User management by admin users.
- [ ] Order management by admin users.
